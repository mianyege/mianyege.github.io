<p>　　In our daily life, you may know some words like “food slave”, “house slave”, “car slave”…But have you ever heard about “screen slave”? “Screen slave”, the Chinese equivalent is “屏(píng)奴(nú)”; this term is used to describe those people who were addicted to their electronic products like Smartphones, IPads and so on. As for “screen slave”, since they are slaves of their Smartphone or computer screen all the time, thus they will suffer from both psychological problems and physical illnesses, spending too much time on their electronic “screens” also lead them have an awful relationship with people around them.</p>
<p>　　So what exactly is a “screen slave”? Obviously, a “screen slave” is someone who slaves to those “screens”. They lower their head and fix their eyes on the screen.  They always hold their Smartphone or IPad in hand, and check their phones frequently to see whether there is a new message; if one day they didn’t bring their phone or IPad with them, they will be extremely upset, anxious or even lost their temper. After their eyes see the “screens” of their phones or computers again, they will calm down and become a normal people again.</p>
<p>　　As for “screen slaves”, the first thing I want to say is that they are very similar with “drug addicts”. They cannot live without their phone screen or computer screen for even one minute. As a result of using their electronic products excessively, most of these “screen slaves” will suffer from some mental illness; most of them are introversive or bad-tempered. They even always frustrated when they found no one call them up or no new message on “Wechat”. I have many “screen slave” friends; they reach for their phone before got out of bed early in the morning, to check QQ,　WeChat, personal emails and so on. Another thing for “screen slaves” is that, they are not always young people, and not always boys. A study made by Beijing Woman’s Federation shows that: “almost 80% of children use mobile clients to play online games, and they spent more than 7 hours a day on the “screen”. And the study also found that, women from 30 to 50 years of age may more easily get addicted to their electronic products than men in their age. (<a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/edu/2013-11/06c-118036492.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://news.xinhuanet.com/edu/2013-11/06c-118036492.htm</a>) .</p>
<p>　　Compared to other “slaves”, “screen slaves” have more dangers! They must confront with more health problems than other people. As we all know, watching the screen of computer or phone for a long time is bad for our eyes and brain. What’s more, a new study which was reported by Network China suggested that: “People who use electronic products excessively will more likely to be obese, or more likely to suffer from hypertension.” The article pointed out the electronic products makes people become lazier, and these products make people have no time to do exercise. Gradually, “screen slaves” will be worried about their health problems. (<a href="http://news.china.com.cn/world/2014-02/20/content_31538415.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://news.china.com.cn/world/2014-02/20/content_31538415.htm</a>) </p>
<p>　　The great poet Rabindranath Tagore once said that: “The most distant way in the world is not the way from birth to the end; it is when I sit near your but you don’t understand I love you.” However, as for “screen slave” I want to change his words into: “The most distant way in the world is not when I sit near you and you don’t understand I love you; it is when I sit near you but you are addicted to your Smartphone!” Spending too much time on phone screen also causes the “screen slave” to have an awful relationship with people around them. There was a piece of old news I still remember: “When a whole family celebrated the Spring Festival together, the children was playing the online games by their IPad; the young couples were chatting with their friends though QQ and Wechat; the grandparents sat on the chairs without any words; finally, the grandpa got so angry that no one cared about them that he left the house heart-broken.” (<a href="http://m.sohu.com/n/354828004/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://m.sohu.com/n/354828004/</a>) In our life, we need to communicate with others face to face, because we couldn’t build a close and eternal relationship only though the “screen” of our phone! The “screen” broke up the relationship that we cherished, and there was a large distance between our hearts. Just for an image, if one day we can only know each other from our electronic products, what’s your feeling? Maybe you will lose a secure feeling because you don’t trust anything you see from the screen, and the relationship between you and others will be awful. </p>
<p>　　In a conclusion, “screen slaves” are a by-product of modern age. People who become a “screen slave” will suffer from many mental problems and physical illnesses, such as obesity; at the same time, using their electronic products excessively makes these people have an awful relationship with people around them. In my opinion, if you are a “screen slave”, you would better not watch your phone screen all the time, but raise your head from now on, only by doing so can you live a better life！</p>
